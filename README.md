# Awesome Claude Plugins

A curated marketplace of awesome plugins for Claude, following the [Claude Plugin Marketplace](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugin-marketplaces) specification.

## About

This repository serves as a plugin marketplace for Claude, providing a centralized location to discover and share Claude plugins. Plugins extend Claude's capabilities and enable integration with various tools and services.

**Note:** The plugin examples and structure in this repository are based on the [official Claude Code plugin examples](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Add Marketplace from GitHub

```bash
/plugin marketplace add GiladShoham/awesome-claude-plugins
```

### Test Marketplace Locally

Before publishing, you can test the marketplace locally:

```

Install a specific plugin:

```

List installed marketplaces:

```bash

## Marketplace Structure

This marketplace follows the Claude plugin marketplace format:

- `marketplace.json` - Marketplace metadata and configuration
- `plugins/` - Directory containing individual plugin directories
- Each plugin is a directory containing:
  - `.claude-plugin/` - Plugin configuration directory
    - `plugin.json` - Plugin metadata (JSON)
  - `hooks/` - Lifecycle hooks
  - `agents/` - Agent definitions
  - `commands/` - Custom commands

## Available Plugins

Browse the `plugins/` directory to discover available plugins. Each plugin includes:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for the plugin
- **Version**: Semantic versioning
- **Description**: What the plugin does
- **Author**: Plugin maintainer information

### Example Plugins

- **Calculator Plugin** (`example-calculator`) v1.0.0 - A simple calculator plugin for performing basic arithmetic operations
- **Plumbward Lite** (`plumbward-lite`) v0.2.2 - Free file-safety and token-cost skills: dry-run shows the full list before anything is deleted, moved or overwritten and waits for your yes; token-diet cuts the habits that burn usage limits.
